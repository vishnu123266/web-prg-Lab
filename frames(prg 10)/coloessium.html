<h1>The Colosseum, Rome</h1>

<p>The Colosseum is a massive elliptical amphitheater in Rome, Italy, built by the Flavian emperors between
 70-80 AD to host public spectacles like gladiatorial contests and animal hunts. Also known as the Flavian 
 Amphitheatre, it was a significant symbol of Roman power and ingenuity, designed to hold tens of thousands 
 of spectators. Despite centuries of damage from earthquakes and neglect, it remains the largest ancient
 amphitheater ever built and a major tourist attraction.  </p>
